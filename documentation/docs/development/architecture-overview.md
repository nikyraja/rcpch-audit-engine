## Epilepsy12 Application Architectural Overview

### Introduction

This overview was originally prepared in order to assist the Privacy Impact Assessment of the E12 platform, but it is of general utility and interest, so has been made part of the documentation site for the project.

### Cloud services

All of the Epilepsy12 application services run in Microsoft Azure cloud services platform, with all the individual resources chosen to be in the UK South data centre region.

Access to the cloud services platform is controlled with named accounts throughout, all of which use two-factor authentication in addition to a username and password combination. Accounts are managed by the RCPCH IT team, and access is granted on a named-individual basis, with limitation of scope of that user's access to the services they would need to manage to do their work.

### Epilepsy12 Django Application

The main application is a web application, written in the **Python** language and using the **Django** framework. It is currently served using Azure App Services which is a cloud-based application deployment platform, but in the future we are transitioning to use a more 'traditional' approach, deploying the application and all dependencies to a virtual machine in the cloud.

A secure connection (HTTPS, also known as SSL) is used to access the application from the web, which allows secure logins and prevents private data being intercepted in transit.

### Database

The application uses a **PostgreSQL** database, which is a common and reliable open-source relational database management system used by millions of other applications. The database is part of the same docker compose setup as the Django app itself and runs on the same VPS. This database is only used for the Epilepsy12 application, and is not shared with any other application.

All the data in the live instance of the application is stored in the database. The VPS running the app and database is backed up daily.

### Authentication

Users authenticate with the application using an email address, and a password. The password is stored in the database, but is encrypted using a secure hashing algorithm, which performs a kind of one-way mathematical function on the password data. This means that even if the database is compromised, the passwords cannot be discovered. However the application can still check that someone has entered the right password by comparing the hash of the password they entered with the hash stored in the database.

Accounts are created manually by RCPCH admin or organisation lead clinicians who first verify that the proposed new user has the right to access the application. The application does not allow users to create their own accounts, since our user base is very specifically defined as the contributors to the Epilepsy12 audit.

#### Workflow

The lead clinician or RCPCH admin create an account in the user management area. This creates an account with the email_confirmed flag set to false, and generates an email to the new user with an individualised and hashed token in the URL. This remains valid for 72 hours, after which time admin can send a new email if the user requests one by emailing the admin team or lead clinician. The email link redirects the user to reset a password which on creation sets the email_confirmed flag to true. This is shown in the user management platform as a pink tick, along with any other badges to denote their status (RCPCH team, superuser etc).

#### Password rules

Passwords must be 10 characters long for regular users, 16 characters for superusers or RCPCH admin. Passwords must contain 1 capital, 1 number and 1 symbol. Passwords are valid for 3 months, after which the user is asked to reset them. All login attempts are logged and if a user fails to log in 5 consecutive times, they are locked out of the platform for 10 minutes.

### Authorisation

User accounts are limited to a single role, which determines what they can do within the application. The exact roles and capabilities are detailed in the [admin user guide](../admin-users/admin-user-guide.md).

### Access constraints

* Users at a specific clinical site can only access data for children at that Trust.
* Users with a national role can access data for all children.
